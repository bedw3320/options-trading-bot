Absolute skew filter: 25Δ RR ≤ -5 vol points defines the minimum tradeable threshold. At ≤ -8 to -10 vol points, the signal strength is strong — skew is meaningfully elevated above historical norms.

This filter works in conjunction with [[skew percentile rank must be 75th or above on 1-year lookback for entry]] — both relative and absolute skew measures should confirm.

- [[the 25-delta risk reversal is the industry-standard skew metric]]
- [[skew percentile rank must be 75th or above on 1-year lookback for entry]]
