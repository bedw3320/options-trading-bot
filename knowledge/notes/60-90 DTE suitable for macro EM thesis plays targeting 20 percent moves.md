# 60-90 DTE suitable for macro EM thesis plays targeting 20 percent moves

The 60-90 DTE tenor is suitable for macro EM thesis plays targeting 20% underlying moves. This longer tenor provides a wider window for the EM overweight thesis to play out, at the cost of more theta decay to manage and wider bid-ask spreads on longer-dated options.

## Connections

- [[30-45 DTE is the primary vehicle for 10 percent target moves]]
- [[at 21 DTE remaining assess position and roll to next monthly if thesis intact]]
- [[the EM variance risk premium operates nearly independently of developed-market VRP]]
