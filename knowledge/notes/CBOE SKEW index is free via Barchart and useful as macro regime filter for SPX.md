# CBOE SKEW index is free via Barchart and useful as macro regime filter for SPX

The CBOE SKEW Index ($SKEW) is available free via Barchart. While SPX-specific, it serves as a valuable macro regime filter for risk reversal entry timing across all US equity positions.

The SKEW index measures the perceived tail risk in the S&P 500 distribution. Higher values indicate the market is pricing in greater left-tail risk — precisely the condition where selling put skew is most rewarding.
