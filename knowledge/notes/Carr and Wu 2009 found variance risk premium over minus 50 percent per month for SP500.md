Carr & Wu (2009) found the variance risk premium exceeds -50% per month for the S&P 500, with an annualized Sharpe ratio of approximately -1.7 for short variance exposure — roughly 5x larger than the equity risk premium's Sharpe ratio.

This quantifies the magnitude of the volatility selling edge but also highlights its risk profile: the distribution of returns from harvesting this premium is deeply negatively skewed.
