EEM (iShares MSCI Emerging Markets) suffered a -66.4% max drawdown in November 2008. Recovery took 2,220 trading sessions. Any put at ≤30% OTM would have been breached during this decline.

This drawdown magnitude is categorically different from US equity drawdowns and underscores why [[defined-risk structures are recommended for EM positions buying 10-delta put protection]].
