EM vol more frequently trades in backwardation compared to US markets, with pronounced humps around scheduled events. Post-event mean reversion is faster than US — creating post-event entry opportunities where vol rapidly normalizes after the catalyst passes.

This faster spike/revert cycle in EM vol creates windows for new risk reversal entries immediately after events resolve.
