EWZ anomaly (February 2026): June-November 2026 expirations show inverted skew driven by bullish speculative demand. Call IV exceeds put IV by 4-5 points. A standard risk reversal here could receive premium from BOTH legs — a structural gift aligned with the EM overweight thesis.

This is unusual and requires [[build specific logic for EWZ-type inverted skew scenarios]].
