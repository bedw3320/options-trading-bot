EWZ (iShares MSCI Brazil) suffered a -77.3% max drawdown in January 2016 and has still not recovered after 16+ years. This is the most severe drawdown among the target EM ETFs.

Position sizing must assume -77% is possible — not just 1-standard-deviation moves. This is the existential constraint for any EM options strategy.
