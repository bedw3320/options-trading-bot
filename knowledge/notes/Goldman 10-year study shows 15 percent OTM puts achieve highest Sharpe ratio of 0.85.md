Goldman Sachs' 10-year study on systematic put selling found that 15% OTM puts achieve the highest Sharpe ratio of 0.85 across all strike distances and tenors tested. Additionally, 1-month tenors outperformed 12-month tenors on both absolute and risk-adjusted returns for put selling.

This directly informs strike selection for risk reversals: the short put leg at ~15% OTM (approximately 15-25 delta) sits at the sweet spot of the skew curve where premium collection is richest relative to risk.
