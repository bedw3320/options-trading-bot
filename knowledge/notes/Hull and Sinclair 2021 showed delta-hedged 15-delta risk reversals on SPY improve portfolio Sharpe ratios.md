Hull & Sinclair (2021) demonstrated that delta-hedged 15-delta risk reversals on SPY improve portfolio Sharpe ratios. The key insight: OTM puts are systematically overpriced relative to OTM calls — implied risk-neutral skewness consistently exceeds subsequently realized skewness.

This means the put premium you collect when selling the short put leg systematically exceeds the fair value of the risk you're taking, creating a persistent edge.

## Evidence

Hull & Sinclair (2021), SSRN. Study focused on SPY options with 15-delta risk reversals.

## Connections

- [[the skew risk premium is real and persistent with approximately half of implied skew representing compensatable risk premium]]
- [[Goldman 10-year study shows 15 percent OTM puts achieve highest Sharpe ratio of 0.85]]
