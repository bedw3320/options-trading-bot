The IV percentile filter requires options to be broadly expensive (≥ 60th percentile) to ensure favorable credit collection on the short put leg. When IV is low, the absolute premium received from selling puts may be too small to justify the risk.

Data source: ORATS ivPct field or TastyTrade IV rank.
