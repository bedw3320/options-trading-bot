SKEW and VIX are not correlated. The optimal setup is high SKEW + low-to-moderate VIX ("stealth tail-risk pricing") — expensive puts without genuinely elevated realized volatility.

Current environment approximates this: CBOE SKEW ~140, VIX ~21, 30-day realized vol on SPX barely above 10%.

This divergence is the ideal condition for risk reversals because it means you're collecting rich put premium (high SKEW = steep skew) while the underlying isn't actually moving enough to threaten the short put (low realized vol).

## Connections

- [[CBOE SKEW above 130 indicates significantly better win rates and above 140 is strongest signal]]
- [[SPX implied vol approximately 15 percent versus realized vol approximately 10 percent showing wide gap]]
- [[implied vol must exceed trailing realized vol to confirm overpricing]]
