As of February 2026, SPX put skew sits in the top percentile of its post-July 2024 range with CBOE SKEW Index around 140 — well above the 130 threshold that [[CBOE SKEW above 130 indicates significantly better win rates and above 140 is strongest signal]].

## Connections
- [[SKEW and VIX are not correlated and the optimal setup is high SKEW plus low-to-moderate VIX]]
- [[SPX implied vol approximately 15 percent versus realized vol approximately 10 percent showing wide gap]]
