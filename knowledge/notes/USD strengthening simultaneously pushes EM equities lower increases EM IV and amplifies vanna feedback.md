USD strengthening simultaneously pushes EM equities lower (delta loss), increases EM IV (vega loss via skew steepening), and amplifies vanna feedback. All Greeks move against the position simultaneously — the 'left-tail cluster.'

This is the most dangerous scenario for EM risk reversals because there is no offsetting positive effect on any leg.
