Unresolved: assess whether end-of-day screening (using ORATS daily data) is sufficient for entry signal generation, or whether intraday data feeds are needed. The risk reversal strategy targets swing trades (30-45 DTE), so daily screening may be adequate — but intraday skew shifts during market stress could affect entry quality.

## Connections
- [[ORATS provides pre-calculated skew parameters at 399 per year optimal for systematic screening]]
- [[skew percentile rank must be 75th or above on 1-year lookback for entry]]
