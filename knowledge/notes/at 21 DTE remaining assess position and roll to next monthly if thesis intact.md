At 21 DTE remaining, assess the position. Roll to the next monthly cycle if the thesis is intact. Avoid holding through high-impact EM events unless specifically trading the event premium.

The 21 DTE trigger balances theta acceleration (short put theta increases as expiration approaches) against gamma risk (gamma spikes near expiration, increasing the danger of the short put moving toward ATM).

## Connections
- [[30-45 DTE is the primary vehicle for 10 percent target moves]]
- [[no high-impact events within DTE window unless specifically trading the event premium]]
