description: "Open: need different entry mechanics when skew inverts (call IV > put IV) as seen in EWZ June-Nov 2026"

Unresolved: build specific logic for EWZ-type inverted skew scenarios where call IV exceeds put IV. Standard risk reversal entry mechanics assume negative skew (puts more expensive than calls). When skew inverts, the structure can potentially collect premium from BOTH legs, but different screening and calibration logic is needed.
