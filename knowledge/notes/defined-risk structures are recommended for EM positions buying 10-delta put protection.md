Defined-risk structures are recommended for EM positions — buy a 10-delta put as a protection leg to cap downside. For US equities, buying a 5-delta put is optional.

Given historical EM drawdowns of -66% to -77%, naked short puts on EM ETFs represent existential risk. The cost of the protection leg reduces the net credit but transforms the payoff from unlimited loss to defined maximum loss.
