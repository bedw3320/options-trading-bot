Unresolved: design real-time vanna monitoring that alerts when position vanna exceeds a threshold relative to portfolio DXY exposure. Given that [[vanna is the dominant second-order Greek in risk reversals creating dangerous feedback in equity markets]], monitoring aggregate vanna is critical for EM positions where USD strength triggers the left-tail cluster.

## Connections
- [[vanna is the dominant second-order Greek in risk reversals creating dangerous feedback in equity markets]]
- [[USD strengthening simultaneously pushes EM equities lower increases EM IV and amplifies vanna feedback]]
