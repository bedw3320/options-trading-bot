Unresolved: develop a Kelly-based or fixed-fractional position sizing framework that survives -77% EWZ-type drawdowns without ruin. Current sizing parameters (2-3% for EM, 3-5% for US) are starting points — need to validate these survive historical worst cases.

## Connections
- [[EWZ suffered minus 77.3 percent max drawdown in January 2016 and has still not recovered after 16 plus years]]
- [[EM ETF risk reversal position size is 2-3 percent reduced for higher volatility]]
