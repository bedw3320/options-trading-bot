# Greeks and Volatility

How Greeks behave in risk reversal positions — first-order, second-order, and cross-Greeks.

## First-Order Greeks

- [[a 25-delta put and 15-delta call risk reversal initializes at approximately plus 0.40 delta]]
- [[zero-cost risk reversals are approximately theta-neutral with directional tilt]]
- [[risk reversals are slightly net short vega in asymmetric configurations]]

## Second-Order Greeks

- [[vanna is the dominant second-order Greek in risk reversals creating dangerous feedback in equity markets]]
- [[volga is approximately zero in risk reversals distinguishing them from straddles]]
- [[the gamma profile of risk reversals is fundamentally asymmetric]]

## Volatility Surface Dynamics

- [[during IV spikes skew steepens making risk reversals functionally net short vol even when nominally vega-neutral]]
- [[SKEW and VIX are not correlated and the optimal setup is high SKEW plus low-to-moderate VIX]]

## EM-Specific

- [[USD strengthening simultaneously pushes EM equities lower increases EM IV and amplifies vanna feedback]]
- [[EM vol more frequently trades in backwardation with pronounced humps around events]]
