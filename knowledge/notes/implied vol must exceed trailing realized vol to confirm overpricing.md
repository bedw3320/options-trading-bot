The IV-to-HV spread filter requires implied volatility to exceed trailing 30-day realized volatility. This confirms that options are genuinely overpriced relative to actual market movement — the spread between what the market is pricing and what's actually occurring creates the edge.

Current example (Feb 2026): SPX implied ~15% vs. realized ~10% — a wide gap confirming overpricing.
