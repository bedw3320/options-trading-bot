The optimal short put strike is 15-25 delta, approximately 7-15% OTM. This is the richest portion of the skew curve — approximately 1.0-1.3 standard deviations below spot. The long call strike (10-20Δ) is determined by the zero-cost constraint.

High skew allows buying closer-to-ATM calls than normal because the put credit is larger.
