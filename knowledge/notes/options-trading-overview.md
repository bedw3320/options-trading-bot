# Options Trading Overview

Core concepts underpinning the zero-cost risk reversal strategy on high-skew equities.

## Key Concepts

- [[the skew risk premium is real and persistent with approximately half of implied skew representing compensatable risk premium]]
- [[the 25-delta risk reversal is the industry-standard skew metric]]
- [[zero-cost risk reversals sell overpriced puts to finance OTM calls in elevated-skew environments]]

## Strategy Components

- [[risk-reversals]] — Full strategy construction and management
- [[greeks-and-volatility]] — Greek dynamics specific to risk reversals
- [[screening-and-filters]] — How to identify tradeable skew

## Academic Foundation

- [[skew and variance premia are manifestations of the same underlying risk factor]]
- [[the EM variance risk premium operates nearly independently of developed-market VRP]]
