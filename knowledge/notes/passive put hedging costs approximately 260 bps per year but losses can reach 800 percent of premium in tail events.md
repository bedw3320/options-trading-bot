Verdad Capital, using OptionMetrics data, found that passive put hedging (30% OTM, 3-month tenor, monthly roll) costs approximately 260 basis points per year. Premium sellers earn the mirror — approximately 260 bps/year — but with losses that can reach -800% of premium collected during tail events.

This quantifies the fundamental asymmetry: the edge from put selling is real (~260 bps/year), but the loss distribution is deeply negatively skewed. Position sizing and defined-risk structures are existential requirements, not optional enhancements.
