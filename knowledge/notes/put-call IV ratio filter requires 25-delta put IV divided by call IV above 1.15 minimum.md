The put-call IV ratio filter requires 25-delta put IV divided by 25-delta call IV to be above 1.15 as a minimum tradeable threshold. Above 1.25 represents a strong signal.

## Connections
- [[the 25-delta risk reversal is the industry-standard skew metric]]
- [[25-delta risk reversal of minus 5 vol points is tradeable and minus 8 to 10 is a strong signal]]
