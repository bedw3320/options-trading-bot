The skew risk premium and the variance risk premium are manifestations of the same underlying risk factor. This has critical portfolio construction implications: combining a risk reversal strategy (harvesting skew premium) with a variance selling strategy (harvesting variance premium) does NOT provide the diversification benefit that combining independent alpha streams would suggest.

## Evidence

Kozhan, Neuberger & Schneider (2013), SSRN.

## Connections

- [[the skew risk premium is real and persistent with approximately half of implied skew representing compensatable risk premium]]
- [[Carr and Wu 2009 found variance risk premium over minus 50 percent per month for SP500]]
