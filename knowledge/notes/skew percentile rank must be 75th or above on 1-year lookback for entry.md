The primary entry filter requires the skew percentile rank to be at or above the 75th percentile on a 1-year (252-day) lookback. This means the current 25Δ risk reversal is wider (more negative) than 75% of readings in the past year.

Data source: ORATS slope/deriv fields provide pre-calculated skew parameters.
