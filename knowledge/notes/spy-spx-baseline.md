# SPY/SPX Baseline

SPX serves as the baseline skew reference for the risk reversal strategy.

## Current Conditions (Feb 2026)

- [[SPX put skew in top percentile of post-July 2024 range with CBOE SKEW around 140]]
- [[SPX implied vol approximately 15 percent versus realized vol approximately 10 percent showing wide gap]]
- [[SKEW and VIX are not correlated and the optimal setup is high SKEW plus low-to-moderate VIX]]

## Academic Evidence

- [[Hull and Sinclair 2021 showed delta-hedged 15-delta risk reversals on SPY improve portfolio Sharpe ratios]]
- [[Carr and Wu 2009 found variance risk premium over minus 50 percent per month for SP500]]
- [[Goldman 10-year study shows 15 percent OTM puts achieve highest Sharpe ratio of 0.85]]
