Pre-defined stop-loss at put strike breach plus 3% for US equities and plus 5% for EM ETFs. The wider EM stop accommodates the greater gap risk in EM instruments.

Rolling down and/or out costs 2-3x the original credit received when volatility is elevated — making the stop-loss the preferred exit over rolling in most scenarios.
