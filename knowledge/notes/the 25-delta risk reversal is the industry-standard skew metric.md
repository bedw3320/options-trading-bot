The 25-delta risk reversal (25Δ RR = IV of 25Δ call minus IV of 25Δ put) is the industry-standard skew metric. In equities, this value is persistently negative — puts trade at higher implied volatility than equidistant calls due to structural demand for downside hedges.

The strategy edge emerges when this skew becomes unusually steep relative to its own history — selling overpriced puts when skew is at extreme levels.
