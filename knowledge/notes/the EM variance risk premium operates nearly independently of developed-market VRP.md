Qiao, Xu, Zhang & Zhou (2024) conducted the first comprehensive study of the EM variance risk premium across 9 countries (2006-2023). Key findings:

1. EMVRP predicts EM stock returns for horizons >6 months (adjusted R² of 5.1-14.2%)
2. EMVRP predicts EM currency returns
3. Near-zero correlation (0.11) with developed-market VRP = truly independent alpha stream

This is the core diversification argument for adding EM risk reversals alongside US equity risk reversals — they harvest different risk premia.

## Evidence
