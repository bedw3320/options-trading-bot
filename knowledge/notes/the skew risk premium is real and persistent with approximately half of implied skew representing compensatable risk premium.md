Almost half of implied volatility skew represents risk premium — not an informational signal about future returns. This is the foundational finding that makes selling put skew a positive expected-value strategy.

Combined with the finding that [[skew and variance premia are manifestations of the same underlying risk factor]], this implies risk reversal strategies should NOT be combined with pure variance-selling strategies expecting diversification — they harvest the same risk factor.

## Evidence

Kozhan, Neuberger & Schneider (2013), SSRN. The study decomposed implied skew into an informational component and a risk premium component across equity index options.
