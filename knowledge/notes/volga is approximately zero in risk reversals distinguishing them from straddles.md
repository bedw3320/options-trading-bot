The long call's positive volga (vomma) offsets the short put's negative volga contribution. Risk reversals are not meaningfully exposed to vol-of-vol, distinguishing them from straddles or butterflies where volga is a significant risk factor.

This means the risk reversal position doesn't benefit from or suffer from changes in the volatility-of-volatility. The risk is concentrated in first-order Greeks (delta, vega) and the second-order cross-Greek vanna.
