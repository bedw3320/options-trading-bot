The zero-cost risk reversal sells overpriced puts to finance OTM calls in elevated-skew environments. This is a positive expected-value strategy because the skew risk premium means puts are systematically overpriced relative to calls at equivalent delta distances.

Return objective: 10-20% underlying moves generating 5-10x options returns via zero-cost (financing-neutral) risk reversals.

## Connections

- [[the skew risk premium is real and persistent with approximately half of implied skew representing compensatable risk premium]]
- [[the zero-cost calibration algorithm starts at 20-delta put and finds the call strike matching the credit]]
- [[optimal short put strike is 15-25 delta at 7-15 percent OTM where skew curve is richest]]
