# Vault Methodology

This vault uses the Research preset from arscontexta, adapted for options trading strategy research.

## Configuration Rationale

- [[atomic granularity suits options research because each Greek dynamic, parameter range, and academic claim is independently composable]]
- [[flat organization prevents false hierarchies in options knowledge where Greeks, strategies, and instruments cross-cut]]

## Processing Pipeline

The 6-R pipeline (Record → Reduce → Reflect → Reweave → Verify → Rethink) processes research documents into atomic claims, connects them, and validates the knowledge graph.

## Evolution History

- 2026-02-20: Initial vault creation from research preset with options trading vocabulary
