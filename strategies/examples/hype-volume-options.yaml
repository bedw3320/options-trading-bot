  Social media hype (Reddit, StockTwits, TikTok influencers) drives unusual
  options volume on tickers. Detect the signal via social mention surges and
  options flow analysis, then ride the momentum via options or equity positions.
  This is a short-term momentum strategy targeting viral/hype-driven moves.

notes:
  - "This strategy is higher risk - social hype can reverse quickly"
  - "Prefer options for leveraged exposure with defined risk"
  - "For equity positions, use tight stop losses"
  - "TikTok has no reliable API - for v1, use Reddit/StockTwits as proxy"
  - "Consider time-of-day: hype trades often peak in first 2 hours of trading"
  - "Avoid illiquid options - check bid-ask spread before entering"
  - "Paper trade extensively before going live with this strategy"
